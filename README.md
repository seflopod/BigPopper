BigPopper
=========

Bubble popping shooter made for a Unity tutorial.  The original point was to teach people the basics of Unity prior to the Global Game Jam 2013.  I've since updated it to use a custom shader and actually look okay as a game.

The web demo can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105401308/big_popper_web/index.html)
